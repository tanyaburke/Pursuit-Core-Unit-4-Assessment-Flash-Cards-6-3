//- **1: Cards** - a collection view of all YOUR flash cards.

//### Flash cards collection
//The first view controller contains the user's flash card collection. When the view loads, each "card" should show the title of the card. When a user taps the card, it should use an animation to load the "back" of the card, which lists the description (facts) of the card.
//
//The user should be able to delete a flash card from their collection, and should NOT be able to add a card that is a duplicate of one that already exists.

import UIKit

class CardsViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        view.backgroundColor = .yellow
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
    

    /*
    // MARK: - Navigation

    // In a storyboard-based application, you will often want to do a little preparation before navigation
    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
        // Get the new view controller using segue.destination.
        // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
    }
