//- **3: Search Online** - a collection view that loads the results of a call to the API below. You can add flash cards to YOUR list using the results of this API call.

//### Adding a Flash Card from the Search tab
//The third view controller loads flash cards from the endpoint below. The user can look through the list of flash cards and add one to their persisted collection using an action sheet. The user should be able to click on a flash card in this collection and view the description using a transition animation.


import UIKit

class SearchViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
   view.backgroundColor = .systemTeal
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
    

    /*
    // MARK: - Navigation

    // In a storyboard-based application, you will often want to do a little preparation before navigation
    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
        // Get the new view controller using segue.destination.
        // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
    }
